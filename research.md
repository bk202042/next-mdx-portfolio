## Mobile Header UI Improvement

**Objective**: Improve the mobile UI for the header navigation, specifically
addressing the cramped layout and overlapping elements.

**Approach**: Implement a responsive hamburger menu for mobile screens.

**Key Technologies**: React (useState), Tailwind CSS.

**Planned Changes**:

- Hide horizontal navigation links on small screens.
- Display a hamburger icon to toggle a mobile navigation menu.
- The mobile menu will display navigation links vertically.
- The "BK" logo and theme toggle will remain in the header.

**Icon Sourcing Strategy**:

- Check for existing icon components.
- If a new icon library is needed, use Context7 to find installation
  documentation for `lucide-react`.
